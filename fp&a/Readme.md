# Welcome to your new project!



By replacing the contents of this **readme** file, you can provide information about your project so that other portal users could learn what it is about, what they can *do* with your project, and how they can *use* it. Readme is usually the first item that portal visitors will see once opening your project.



Here is how you add a first notebook to your project. Enjoy!
