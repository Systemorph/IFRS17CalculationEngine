Allow for a granularity of various types of assets and liabilities, being impacted by various risks to a defined degree. This will be done by choosing a suitably defined two-way relationship between amount type projections (mostly asset and liability types) and basic risks, as well as choosing a cashflow like shape to project the risk (e.g., constant, asset pattern, liability pattern, premium earned pattern, correlated pattern, etc.).",
