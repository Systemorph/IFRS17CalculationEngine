                "Migration is a powerful tool that allows us to keep the same Database (DB) during the whole lifetime of the project, without any need to remove it if one needs to modify the DB, e.g. via adding a removing certain tables or columns. With the migration, if modification of the DB is needed, we do not remove the old DB, but rather migrate it incrementally. Note, however, that running a project with migration is a choice rather than a default option. If you are OK with removing the DB each time when some change in the tables structure is needed, migration is not necessary. ",

                "\nAt the first step we perform the [scaffolding](Scaffold.) The scaffolding procedure naturally outputs the migration code and the model snapshot. The migration code is the code that we should run in order to change the DB according to our new requirements, or, alternatively, if we start from scratch, to create the DB. The snapshot contains all the information about the structure of the DB after the migration. It is necessary to have the snapshot, in order for us not to start from scratch at the next migration, but rather only *implement the changes*. Each time when the DB has to be changed, we should scaffold the new model, taking into the account the snapshot of the previous step. The snapshot of the new scaffold should be copied manually without changes into the [Snapshot notebook](Snapshot). We have done it alrerady for the initial migration, please do not forget to change the [Snapshot notebook](Snapshot) for any subsequent migration.",

                "\n",
