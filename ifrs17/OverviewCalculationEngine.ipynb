The basic inputs are: modeled future **cash flows**, actual amounts for **groups of insurance contracts** and other relevant parameters (Yield Curve, FX rates, etc...). Alternatively, pre-computed figures can also be imported in the solution. The output is a set of calculated results (Contractual Service Margin, Loss Component, Financial Performance, etc...) displayed in interactive and intuitive reports. These results can further be used for IFRS 17 reporting, analysis, accounting, steering and other management information.",
