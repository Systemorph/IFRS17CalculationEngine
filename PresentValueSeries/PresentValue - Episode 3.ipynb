Present Values are the amount of money that someone would pay in the present day for the contracts of the group up to their run off. The starting point are the so called *Nominal Cashflows*, which express the amounts of cash and cash equivalents being transferred into and out of a business. Cashflow values are **discounted** according to the *Yield Curve* provided as economic input in order to take into account the corresponding Interest Accretion, and the discounted figures are **cumulated** to find the **Present Values**.

While the period is typically a quarter, the **Analysis of Change** from BoP to EoP per group of contract is made considering for each step the variation of the cashflow so as to enhance the readability of the value changes. To this aim it is necessary to **evaluate the Present Value difference** between each step, yielding the figures to be shown in the result table.",
